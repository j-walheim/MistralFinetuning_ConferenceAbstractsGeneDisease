Analyze the abstract below and extract disease and gene information. Only include explicitly stated facts. Use "n/a" if information is not clearly provided. Do not infer or guess. Respond in this exact JSON format:
{
  "Disease": "Disease name or n/a",
  "Genes": "Gene1, Gene2, Gene3 or n/a"
}

Rules:
- Only include explicitly stated disease and genes
- List all genes as a comma-separated string in the Genes field
- Use "n/a" if no disease or genes are mentioned
- Prioritize precision over completeness
- When in doubt, use "n/a"
- Do not include any additional fields or comments

Examples:
{"Disease": "n/a", "Genes": "TP53, MDM2"}

{"Disease": "n/a", "Genes": "n/a"}

{"Disease": "Lung Cancer", "Genes": "n/a"}

{"Disease": "Breast Cancer", "Genes": "BRCA1, BRCA2"}

{"Disease": "Colorectal Cancer", "Genes": "APC"}
