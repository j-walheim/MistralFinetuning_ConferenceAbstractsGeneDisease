# Gene and Disease Information Extraction from Conference Abstracts

## Overview

This project aims to extract gene and disease information from medical conference abstracts using a fine-tuned version of Mistral 7B in Python. Our goal is to help researchers and healthcare professionals efficiently process the vast amount of information available in medical literature.

## Motivation

The flood of information in medical abstracts presents a challenge for manual review. Major conferences in oncology and cancer research, such as ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology), AACR (American Association for Cancer Research), and ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology), receive thousands of abstract submissions each year. Keeping track of all this information manually is virtually impossible, leading to potential missed opportunities in research and clinical practice. This tool aims to automate the extraction process, saving time and effort while maintaining accuracy.

## Key Features

Extracts gene and disease information from conference abstracts. Results are stored in JSON format and can be explored using a streamlit GUI. 


## Future Developments

This is the first version of our tool. Future iterations will include additional information extraction capabilities, such as:

- Clinical trial identification and staging
- Therapy types used in studies
- Biomarker information
- Patient cohort characteristics
